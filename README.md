# MACHINE-DOWNTIME-DETECTION-USING-IOT

Project Title: Machine Downtime Detection with ESP8266 Controller and Sensors

This repository contains the code and instructions for building a machine downtime detection system using ESP8266 controller and various sensors, including vibration, sound, and temperature sensors. The system monitors the readings of the sensors and sends them to the Blynk cloud for visualization and analysis. Once the machine stops or a fault is detected, an alert is pushed through WhatsApp.

Installation:
Clone the repository using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/PRAVEEN-RAJA-SK/MACHINE-DOWNTIME-DETECTION-USING-IOT

Set up the ESP8266 controller and sensors according to the circuit diagram provided in the repository.

Upload the code to the ESP8266 controller using the Arduino IDE.

Install the Blynk app on your mobile device and create a new account.

Create a new project in the Blynk app and obtain the authentication token.

Replace the auth variable in the code with your authentication token.

Configure the Blynk virtual pins according to the code.

Usage:
Turn on the machine and make sure the sensors are connected properly.

Open the Blynk app and start monitoring the readings of the sensors in real-time.

If the machine stops or a fault is detected, an alert will be pushed through WhatsApp.
